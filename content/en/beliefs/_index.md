Our motto is **repent**â€”a transformed way of thinking that leads to a transformed way of living.

This is impossible without solid explanatory preaching and teaching based on biblical doctrines.

That is why, like all true Christians before us,  

we believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible.

And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, begotten of the Father before all ages: Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one essence with the Father, through whom all things were made.

Who, for us humans and for our salvation, came down from heaven and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man;

and was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, suffered, and was buried;

and rose again on the third day, in accordance with the Scriptures;

and ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of the Father;

and will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and His kingdom will have no end.

And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of life, who proceeds from the Father, who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets.

We believe in one holy, universal, and apostolic Church.

We confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.

We look for the resurrection of the dead  

and the life of the age to come. Amen.

In detail, the church's theology follows the Westminster Confession of Faith.
